# Learning-Go
A place to put code while learning Go.

Each folder represents what I wrote as part of watching different learning videos.  I focused on practicality over theory for the videos that were chosen.  Care was taken to add relevant comments and provide extra elements not in the videos to draw more parallels with other languages.  Definitely check the README files for each project folder.

**NOTE:** These projects were placed under a workspace style directory structure.  It is based on the GOPATH environment variable.  By default it is set up in you user home directory.  To get started, I created the following directory structure under my home directory. 

	+-go
	  |
	  +-bin
	  +-pkg
	  +-src
	    |
	    +-github.com
	      |
	      +-jasonkretzer
	      
On my github, I then created a Learning-Golang repository and cloned it into my jasonkretzer folder.  This makes it match the url structure for the repo.
